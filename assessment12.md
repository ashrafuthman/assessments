 
# Problem: Finding your way
You have a map (your input):
```
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#..^.....
........#.
#.........
......#...
```
The map shows your current position with `^` (to indicate you are currently facing **up** from the perspective of the map). Any obstructions are shown as `#`.
You follow strict rules for moving:
- If there is something directly in front of you, turn right 90 degrees.
- Otherwise, take a step forward.
Following these rules, you move several times until you reach an obstacle:
```
....#.....
....^....#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#...
```
Because there is now an obstacle in front you, you turn right before continuing straight in your new facing direction:
```
....#.....
........>#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#...
```
Reaching another obstacle, your turn right again and continue downward:
```
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#......v.
........#.
#.........
......#...
```
This process continues for a while, but you eventually leave the mapped area:
```
....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#v..
```
By following your route you can determine which specific positions you have passed to get to the exit. **Including your starting position**, the positions visited before leaving the area are marked with an X:
```
....#.....
....XXXXX#
....X...X.
..#.X...X.
..XXXXX#X.
..X.X.X.X.
.#XXXXXXX.
.XXXXXXX#.
#XXXXXXX..
......#X..
```
In this example, you will visit **`41`** distinct positions on your map.
Print the number of distinct positions you will visit before leaving the mapped area in the map from `input.txt`.
